      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Hey there! I'm Stephanie Collins Chinaza, an enthusiastic web development student who's always up for a good challenge. Coding, coffee, and creative problem-solving are my fuel for success.</p>
      <p>Fun fact: I don't like cheese ðŸ§€! Yep, no pizza toppings or cheesy snacks for me! But, Iâ€™m all about exploring new technologies and binge-watching the latest tech videos. My goal? To become a full-stack developer and build some truly awesome web experiences!</p>
      <p>In this project, I've created a simple blog system using Node.js and Express. It's all part of my journey to mastering backend development. Stay tuned for more as I continue to level up my skills! ðŸš€</p>
